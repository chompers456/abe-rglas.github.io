This site was made by the Trans Patient Union at McGill. Our site is only one part of a larger effort to compile an exhaustive resource on how to access gender-affirming care in Quebec - that project, with its larger scope, is being tackled by the [Community-University Research Exchange](https://www.qpirgconcordia.org/2012/09/cure-2/). It is in the works and will be linked when published. We'd like to thank all the community organizations in Montreal and beyond who have given resources, feedback, and time.
