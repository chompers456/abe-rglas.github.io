# Dr. Landry
Dr. Landry is a private doctor.
## Associated Clinic
[Clinic One](...\clinics\clinics-template.md)
## Pre-Prescription Requirements
One patient was given an informed consent sheet to look at before the appointment, and was told to put a star next to anything he had concerns about. One of the items on the sheet was that you open yourself up to harassment by transitioning.

Two patients reported getting a baseline bloodtest - and one reported not getting one, although this patient did see Dr. Landry several years earlier than other respondents. 

Four out of four respondents reported only needing one appointment. 

One patient said Dr Landry never mentioned fertility preservation; another says she didn't feel pressured to pursue it, but wasn't fully informed about the options, either; another said it was brought up but wasn't pushed on. 

Two out of two respondents reported not needing a dysphoria diagnosis. 

One patient reported that the cost of the initial appointment was $295, then $195 for the check-up for the first month, and then later appointments were $75. 

One patient reported that Dr. Landry brought up surgeries and asked if he wanted a referral. He was also given a list of psychologists for a referral for top surgery. 

## Prescription Practices
According to what survey and interview respondents have reported - 
Patient One:
* He started at 5g T gel, then switched to injections with 0.2mL delastryl, and increased to 0.3mL delastryl.
Patient Two:
* Injections and pills were mentioned as options, and she was advised to take them sublingually.
* She started at 2mg for the first month, then 5mg for the next 11 months, then moved to injections after one year, at a dose of 0.2mL intramuscularly.
* She was told Dr. Landry was aiming for a hormonal range of between 1200 to 2200 pmol/L, but would adjust based on the patient's comfort
Patient Three:
* He started at 0.2mg with subcutaneous injections, and increased to 0.4mg over a period of 5 months.
Patient Four:
* He specifically asked to start at a lower dose, and started on 25mg T gel for three to four weeks, increased to 50mg for three months, and then got switched to injections.

## Monitoring
Three out of four respondents said they received blood tests every 2 months or more frequently when beginning HRT. One respondent, who saw Dr. Landry earlier, said he received blood tests every 8 months or less frequently. 

One patient reported that:
* the follow-ups are with a nurse practitioner, so you only see Dr. Landry for your initial appointment
* The nurse practitioner asked about side effects, and alters the dose if needed
* The nurse was also able to talk about administration changes.
