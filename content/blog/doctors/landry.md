## Associated Clinic
[Clinic ELNA](@/blog/clinics/ELNA)
## Pre-Prescription Requirements
One patient was given an informed consent sheet to look at before the appointment, and was told to put a star next to anything he had concerns about. One of the items on the sheet was that you open yourself up to harassment by transitioning.

Two patients reported getting a <strong>baseline bloodtest</strong> - and one reported not getting one, although this patient did see Dr. Landry several years earlier than other respondents. 

Four out of four respondents reported only <strong>needing one appointment</strong>. 

One patient said Dr Landry never mentioned <strong>fertility preservation</strong>; another says she didn't feel pressured to pursue it, but wasn't fully informed about the options, either; another said it was brought up but wasn't pushed on. 

Two out of two respondents reported <strong>not needing a dysphoria diagnosis</strong>. 

One patient reported that the <strong>cost</strong> of the initial appointment was $295, then $195 for the check-up for the first month, and then later appointments were $75. 

One patient reported that Dr. Landry brought up <strong>surgeries</strong> and asked if he wanted a referral. He was also given a list of psychologists for a referral for top surgery. 

## Prescription Practices
According to what survey and interview respondents have reported - 

Patient One:
* He started at 5g T gel, then switched to injections with 0.2mL delastryl, and increased to 0.3mL delastryl.

Patient Two:
* Injections and pills were mentioned as options, and she was advised to take them sublingually.
* She started at 2mg for the first month, then 5mg for the next 11 months, then moved to injections after one year, at a dose of 0.2mL intramuscularly.
* She was told Dr. Landry was aiming for a hormonal range of between 1200 to 2200 pmol/L, but would adjust based on the patient's comfort.

Patient Three:
* He started at 0.2mg with subcutaneous injections, and increased to 0.4mg over a period of 5 months.
  
Patient Four:
* He specifically asked to start at a lower dose, and started on 25mg T gel for three to four weeks, increased to 50mg for three months, and then got switched to injections.

## Monitoring
Three out of four respondents said they received <strong>blood tests every 2 months</strong> or more frequently when beginning HRT. One respondent, who saw Dr. Landry earlier, said he received blood tests every 8 months or less frequently. One patient reported that they were advised to check their levels once every 2 to 3 months for the first year on HRT, then once a year after that. 

In terms of <strong>follow-up appointments</strong> one patient reported that:
* the follow-ups are with a nurse practitioner, so you only see Dr. Landry for your initial appointment
* The nurse practitioner asked about side effects, and alters the dose if needed
* The nurse was also able to talk about administration changes.
