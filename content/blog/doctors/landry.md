[Clinic One](...\clinics\clinics-template.md)
## Pre-Prescription Requirements
Two patients reported getting a baseline bloodtest - and one reported not getting one, although this patient did see Dr. Landry several years earlier than other respondents. 

Four out of four respondents reported only needing one appointment. 

One patient said Dr Landry never mentioned fertility preservation; another says she didn't feel pressured to pursue it, but wasn't fully informed about the options, either. 

Two out of two respondents reported not needing a dysphoria diagnosis. 
## Prescription Practices
According to what survey and interview respondents have reported - 
Patient One:
* He started at 5g T gel, then switched to injections with 0.2mL delastryl, and increased to 0.3mL delastryl.
Patient Two:
* Injections and pills were mentioned as options, and she was advised to take them sublingually.
* She started at 2mg for the first month, then 5mg for the next 11 months, then moved to injections after one year, at a dose of 0.2mL intramuscularly.
* She was told Dr. Landry was aiming for a hormonal range of between 1200 to 2200 pmol/L, but would adjust based on the patient's comfort
Patient Three:
* He started at 0.mg with subcutaneous injections, and increased to 0.4mg over a period of 5 months.
