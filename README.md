Here is the documentation for the HRT In Montreal site. The website lists medical professionals in Montreal who are willing to prescribe HRT. We get this information from testimonies.  

We use Zola as a static site generator.

Regulations for contributing to the site -

Style
* Bullet points are full sentences and end with periods.
* In the English site, clinics are listed by their English name.
* Doctors are referred to by "Dr." and then their full name in titles, and Dr. /[last name/] in descriptions.
  
Display of Information
* Mention of fertility treatment, dysphoria diagnosis, a genital exam, administration method, and number of appointments needed are bolded.
  
Preserving Anonymity
* “The most recent experience” section in the doctor page is only added after 2 or more respondents, or when it is clear that this will not identify a respondent, whichever comes later.
* All respondents are referred to by they/them pronouns.
* If there are multiple bullet points of information per individual response, and multiple people have seen a doctor, mix up the responses so that the individual is less identifiable.
* If a fact could likely identify the respondent to a reader - including the doctor - don’t include it.
