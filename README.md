Here is the documentation for the HRT In Montreal site. The website lists medical professionals in Montreal who are willing to prescribe HRT, and is informed by mainly anonymous patient testimony. 

We use Zola as a static site generator.

Style notes:
* In the English site, clinics are listed by their English name.
* Doctors are referred to by "Dr." and then their full name in titles, and Dr. /[last name/] in descriptions.
* Information about needing a gender dysphoria diagnosis, presence of a genital exam, and number of appointments is bolded.
* Respondents are listed numerically.
* Bullet points after what the respondents say are sentences with a period at the end.
* Respondents are referred to by the pronouns they specified. If no pronouns are specified, respondents are referred to by "they" and "them".
