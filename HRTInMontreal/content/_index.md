Below is a list of doctors in Montreal who have prescribed Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) before. Our list is informed by patient testimony, and we don't have the ability to guarantee the truth of claims made by participants. This site is part of a larger effort to compile an exhaustive resource on how to access gender-affirming care in Quebec. This project, lead by the [Community-University Research Exchange](http://www.qpirgconcordia.org/2012/09/cure-2/) is currently in the works and will be linked when published. The organizations which have contributed to the development of this site are the Trans Patient Union (TPU), the Centre for Gender Advocacy (CGA), FEMTL, Action Santé Travesti(e)s et Transexuel(le)s du Québec (ASSTTeQ),  Project10 (P10), Coalition de Jeunesse, and QPIRG-McGill.

The [Computer Task Force](https://ctf.science.mcgill.ca/) at McGill University is hosting this site.
